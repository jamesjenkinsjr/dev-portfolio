Headline: Hi, I'm James - a programmer with a tester's eye for finding bugs and a healthy fear of making 'em.
Bio: Full-stack programmer working out of sunny, swampy Gainesville, FL (Go GATORS!). 
I've been attracted to technology in various forms my entire life, 
and can't resist the urge to pull back the curtain to see how things work. 
I love gaming, craft beer, exploring new cities, and am new to cycling! 
As with my interests, my professional attitude is one of balance: 
embrace challenges, learn from missteps, and remember to enjoy yourself along the way.
